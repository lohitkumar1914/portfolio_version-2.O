Delivering accurate weather information through an intuitive user interface. This project highlights frontend state management and API integration.

## ☀️ Features

- **Current Conditions**: Detailed metrics including humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
- **Visualizations**: Dynamic charts showing temperature trends over time.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find weather data for any city worldwide.

## 💻 Technical Implementation

Utilized **React** for component-based architecture and **Redux Toolkit** for efficient state management across the application. Integrated **Chart.js** to visualize weather patterns effectively. 

### Why Redux?
Handling global state for user preferences (units, theme) and cached API responses made Redux the ideal choice for this scale of application.

## 📱 Responsive Design

Ensured full functionality across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, providing a seamless experience regardless of screen size.
