# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

1.  **Supervised Learning**: Training a model on a labeled dataset.
2.  **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabelled data.
3.  **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error.

## 📊 Common Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting continuous values.
- **Decision Trees**: Used for classification and regression tasks.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Used for grouping data points.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Start with simple datasets and libraries like Scikit-learn to understand the fundamentals.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

By diving into ML, you open doors to solving complex problems with data-driven insights.
